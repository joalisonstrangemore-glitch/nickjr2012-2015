This here is a recreation of the Nick Jr. 2012-2015 website used from March 1, 2012 to June 10, 2015.


You are also able to run this site using xampp without the site itself! Here's how you do it.

Download the project as a zip (Click code, then Download ZIP).
Extract the file, and rename thetoonsofjosh.github.io-master to htdocs.
Download XAMPP and turn on Apache.
Remove the old htdocs folder in C:/xampp and add the new htdocs folder you renamed.
Then go to localhost or 127.0.0.1, and you should see the website.
