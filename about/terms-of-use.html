<p class="description1 clear">PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE (the Agreement) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEB SITE (the &#034;Site&#034;).</p><div class="line articleBlock block-return  "><span class="adTag">advertisement</span><div class="lastUnit"><div class="clear">The Nickelodeon Kids and Family--Parents and Preschool Network (the "Network") is a network of multiple sites (Nickjr.com) for parents and their young children, featuring a welcoming and supportive community where individual voices can be expressed, nurtured and heard, and individual needs respected without judgment. We aim to provide a safe place for parents to let their younger children learn, explore and grow, as well as a safe place for parents to exchange and discover ideas. We believe that one of the best ways of supporting better parenting is by sharing our individual stories and viewpoints. To help keep our Network safe for users of all ages we have established the following specific Terms of Use ("Terms of Use") for our members. Separately, we have set out <a href="http://www.parentsconnect.com/help/community_guidelines.jhtml">Community Guidelines</a> as a general overview of our vision of how the Network community will function. Unlike the Community Guidelines, the Terms of Use is the binding legal agreement that you and each community member (registered or otherwise) makes with us as you participate.
<br/><br/>
The sites which comprise the Network (Nickjr.com and ParentsConnect) are presented to you by Nickelodeon, a business unit of Viacom Media Networks, a division of Viacom International Inc. ("VMN").
<br/><br/>
The target audience for ParentsConnect and its participants is parents, parents-to-be and other adult members of families. The target audience for Nickjr.com is parents of preschool age children (except for the Kids section of Nickjr.com, which is meant for preschool age children and their parents to use together). If you are under 18 years old, by using this Network you certify that your parents/guardians have consented to your use and to this Agreement on your behalf, and you acknowledge and agree that your use of the Network is at their discretion. Until you are 18 years old, your parents/guardians may ask us to modify, deny access to, or terminate your account and we may do so at their request or any time, for any reason, without notice or liability. 
<br/><br/>
These Terms of Use, like the online medium itself, are subject to change. We will notify you of material changes by posting them at our site. We encourage you to check back and review the Terms of Use, from time to time. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, or otherwise alter these Terms of Use at any time. Such changes and/or modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Please review the Terms of Use periodically. Your continued use of the Network following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use. If you do not agree with all of the following Terms of Use, please do not use this Network. 
<br/><br/>
Certain features and services made available through the Network from time to time may be governed by different Terms of Use. For example, different Terms of Use apply to shop.nickjr.com, which is operated by our independent third party service providers. Also, if you choose to register with the Network using a third party service such as Login with Facebook, the terms of service and privacy policy applicable to that service will be applicable. By accessing and using those areas of the Network, you are agreeing to be legally bound by the terms and conditions applicable to those areas. 
</p></div></div></div><div class="line articleBlock block-return  "><span class="adTag">advertisement</span><div class="lastUnit"><h3>FLUX</h3><div class="clear">Many of the great community features on the Network operate using the Flux Platform. Your use of these Flux-powered features is governed both by our Terms of Use and the <a href="http://www.socialproject.com/UserAgreements/enUS/TermsOfUse.html">Flux Terms of Use</a>, which are incorporated herein by reference. Flux is used on a number of social-networking web sites that we refer to as the "Community Networks." The Community Networks allow Flux-registered users ("Members") to create personalized Member profiles, display content, comment on and share information and make friends all within a Community Network, or across multiple Community Networks that you may choose to join. For more important information about your rights and obligations as a Member of Flux and your Community Network(s), please refer to the <a href="http://www.socialproject.com/UserAgreements/enUS/TermsOfUse.html">Flux Terms of Use</a>. </p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="line articleBlock block-return  "><span class="adTag">advertisement</span><div class="lastUnit"><h3>Registration</h3><div class="clear">We may require you to have a unique user name and password combination in order to use certain features and functions of the Network, including discussion boards, user-generated pages, messaging services and certain other features or functions. You may not 
<OL> 
<li> (1) select or use a screen name of another person with the intention of impersonating that person, </br> 
<li> (2) use a screen name of anyone else without authorization, </br> 
<li> (3) use a screen name in violation of the intellectual property or other legal rights of any person or </br> 
<li> (4) use a screen name that VMN considers, in its sole discretion and for any reason, inappropriate. 
</OL>
Your user name and password are personal to you, and you may not allow any others to use your user name or password under any circumstances. You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your user name and password and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do so.
<br/><br/>

You, and not us, are solely responsible and liable for your activity, behavior, use and conduct on the Network and for any use of the Network or any other activity or conduct in connection with the Network by any others who use your user name or password, unless and until you notify us that your user name or password may have been compromised, misappropriated or improperly taken or used by another party. You agree to immediately notify us if you become aware of or believe there is or may have been any unauthorized use of your user name or password or any other need to deactivate your user name or password due to security concerns.
<br/><br/>

During registration (and possibly at certain other times to enable your use of other features or functions or for security purposes), you will be required to provide us with certain information about yourself in order for us to allow you to complete the registration process and to use certain features and functions of the Network. It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information and to keep the information that you provide to us up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or you fail to update the information you give us. Please read our <a href="http://www.nickjr.com/about/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect and use your personal information. By registering with the Network, you agree to allow our staff to contact you at your personal email address about your activity on the Network.
<br/><br/>

You must use your screen name on a regular basis (i.e., log into your Network account) to keep your screen name active. VMN may cancel the registration and screen names of any registered user who we determine, in our sole discretion, has not used such screen name for a period of ninety (90) days. If your screen name is canceled, and you wish to resume your use of the "Friends" features, you will need to re-register and obtain a new screen name. If the screen name that you previously used and which was canceled has not been taken by another registered user of VMN, you may re-register with your canceled screen name. By registering for and using the "ParentsConnect Message Center" feature of the Network, you hereby consent to other users adding you to their "contact list" and contacting or attempting to contact you in connection therewith.

You acknowledge that any reliance upon any review, advice, opinion, statement, or other Content, is at your sole risk. While you may freely discuss any topic on the Network (subject to the <a href="http://www.nickmom.com/community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a>), you should seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the Network.

However, by submitting a Posting, you hereby authorize VMN, and grant VMN, our affiliates and other users the non-exclusive right to use, display, reproduce, modify and distribute, such Postings in whole or in part, throughout the universe in perpetuity in any and all media, now known or hereafter devised, alone, or together or as part of other material of any kind or nature. Without limiting the foregoing, VMN will have the right to use, copy, display, perform, distribute, adapt, modify and re-format the Postings in any manner that VMN may determine. You agree that VMN and our affiliates may identify you as the author of any of your Postings by name, email address or screen name as VMN sees appropriate, in its sole discretion. You acknowledge that Postings may be indexed by online search engines such as Yahoo! and Google. 
<br/><br/>

By submitting a Posting, you represent and warrant to VMN that you have all necessary rights in and to all Postings you provide and all information they contain and that such Postings shall not infringe any proprietary or other rights of third parties or contain any libelous, tortious, or otherwise unlawful information. If your Posting incorporates the name, voice, likeness and/or image of any individual and/or any third party-owned content including without limitation text, graphics, software, music, sound, photographs, videos, messages, posts, data, information or other material, you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant VMN, our affiliates and other users permission to use such name, voice, likeness and/or image of such individual and/or such third party-owned content appearing in the Posting in all media throughout the world in perpetuity. By submitting a Posting, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold VMN, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and/or related entities and parties harmless from and against any breach or alleged breach of any of your representations, warranties or undertakings hereunder. In order to encourage safe dialogue about sensitive subjects, ParentsConnect members have the option of posting anonymously, meaning their username will not appear on the Posting. Keep in mind, however, that while users may have the option to submit Postings that are anonymous vis-a-vis other users of the Network, ParentsConnect may maintain internal records that track each Posting to the unique user name under which the Posting originated. 
<br/><br/>

You will find a button or link labeled "Report Abuse" on every page of the Network. If you believe that any Postings or other content on the Network violates these Terms of Use, please click the "Report Abuse" button to send us a message about it. We will not respond to your message and we reserve the right to take or refrain from taking any or all steps available to us once we receive any such message. VMN has no obligation to delete content that you find personally objectionable but does not violate the Terms of Use.
<br/><br/>

In cases where you feel threatened or believe someone else is in danger, you should contact your local law enforcement agency immediately. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or 911 immediately.
<br/><br/>

VMN may (but is under no obligation to) pre-screen Postings and sweep its discussion boards and other areas of the Network periodically in its sole discretion. That said, VMN is most often a passive conduit of the information that you and other users submit.
<br/><br/>

Any comments, materials, or letters sent by you to VMN regarding the Network other than Postings, including, without limitation, questions, comments, suggestions, criticisms, or the like ("Comments") shall be deemed to be non-confidential and free of any claims of proprietary or personal rights unless you explicitly state in the correspondence that the letter (i) is "not for publication" and (ii) contains "private and proprietary" information that may not be distributed. VMN will have no obligation of any kind with respect to Comments that you do not restrict and VMN will be free to reproduce, use, disclose, exhibit, display, transform, edit, abridge, create derivative works from, and/or distribute Comments that you do not restrict. You expressly acknowledge and agree that VMN may preserve Postings and Comments and may also disclose Postings and Comments if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these Terms of Use; (c) respond to claims that any Postings or Comments violate the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of ParentsConnect, its affiliates, suppliers, users or the public.

VMN discourages the use of profanity or obscenities in Postings and any Postings containing prohibited language will bounce back to the user.

VMN reserves the right to delete any such material from the Network.
